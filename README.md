# StudyNotion-App
 
## Project Description

StudyNotion is a fully functional ed-tech platform that enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERN stack, which includes ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS.

StudyNotion aims to provide:

− A seamless and interactive learning experience for students, making education more accessible and engaging.

− A platform for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect with learners across the globe.

In summary, StudyNotion is a versatile and intuitive ed-tech platform that is designed to provide an immersive learning experience to students and a platform for instructors to showcase their expertise. In the following sections, we will delve into the technical details of the platform, which will provide a comprehensive understanding of the platform's features and functionalities.

## Features
User Authentication: Study Notion provides secure user registration and authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles with ease.

Courses and Lessons: Instructors can create and edit created courses. Students can enroll in courses, access course materials, and track their progress.

Progress Tracking: Study Notion allows students to track their progress in enrolled courses. They can view completed lessons, scores on quizzes and assignments, and overall course progress.

Payment Integration: Study Notion integrates with Razorpay for payment processing. Users can make secure payments for course enrollment and other services using various payment methods supported by Razorpay.

Search Functionality: Users can easily search for courses, lessons, and resources using the built-in search feature. This makes it convenient to find relevant content quickly.

Instructor Dashboard: Instructors have access to a comprehensive dashboard to view information about their courses, students, and income. The dashboard provides charts and visualizations to present data clearly and intuitively. Instructors can monitor the total number of students enrolled in each course, track course performance, and view their income generated from course sales.

## Technologies Used:

### Front-end:

ReactJS: For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

CSS and Tailwind: Styling frameworks to enhance the visual appeal.

Redux: State management for handling complex state logic.
